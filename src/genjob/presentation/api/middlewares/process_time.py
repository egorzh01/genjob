"""
Middleware to track and add process time to the response headers.

This middleware captures the time when the request is started and when the response is sent.
The difference of these two times is added to the response headers as 'X-Process-Time'.

The time is formatted as a float with 4 digits after the decimal point.

    Example:
        X-Process-Time: 0.0123 seconds
